# Project Refactoring Plan

This document outlines a plan to refactor the project for improved structure, maintainability, and scalability.

## 1. Component Reorganization

**Goal:** Improve project organization by moving page-specific components to their respective page directories.

**Current Structure:**
- `components/sections/` contains components used across different pages as well as page-specific ones.

**Proposed Structure:**
- Create a `components` subdirectory within each page's directory (e.g., `app/faq/components`).
- Move page-specific components from `components/sections` to these new directories.

**Example:**
```
- app/
  - faq/
    - components/
      - FAQ.tsx
    - page.tsx
  - pricing/
    - components/
      - PricingList.tsx
    - page.tsx
```

## 2. Styling Improvements

**Goal:** Adopt a more modular styling approach to avoid global scope pollution and improve maintainability.

**Proposal:**
- Implement CSS Modules for component-level styling.
- Each component will have its own `.module.css` file, ensuring styles are scoped locally.

**Example:**
- A component `Button.tsx` would have a corresponding `Button.module.css`.

## 3. Create a Reusable Layout

**Goal:** Eliminate code duplication and ensure a consistent layout across all pages.

**Proposal:**
- Develop a `PageLayout` component that includes the common layout elements (header, footer, etc.).
- Refactor existing pages to use this new `PageLayout` component.

## 4. Externalize Data

**Goal:** Decouple content from the codebase to make it easier to manage and update.

**Proposal:**
- Move hardcoded data (e.g., FAQ questions, pricing information) to external JSON files.
- Update components to fetch data from these JSON files.

**Example:**
- Create `data/faq.json` and `data/pricing.json`.
- Components will read from these files to render content.
