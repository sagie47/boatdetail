    "question": "How long does a typical boat detail take?",
    "answer": "The time required depends on the size of your boat and the services selected. A basic exterior wash for a 20ft boat may take 2-3 hours, while a full detail package could take a full day. For larger vessels or those requiring extensive restoration work, we may schedule multiple days to ensure the job is done to our high standards."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to prepare my boat before your arrival?",
    "answer": "While no extensive preparation is required, removing personal belongings and clearing clutter from surfaces will help us work more efficiently. For interior detailing, removing loose items helps us clean more thoroughly. If possible, having access to water and electricity is beneficial, though our mobile service comes equipped with our own supplies when needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you offer mobile detailing services?",
    "answer": "Yes! We are a fully mobile boat detailing service, serving Kelowna and the entire Okanagan Valley. We come to your location, whether your boat is docked at a marina, stored at your home, or at a storage facility. Our mobile setup includes all necessary equipment, water supply, and eco-friendly cleaning solutions."
  },
  {
    "question": "What products do you use for detailing?",
    "answer": "We use premium, marine-grade products that are specifically designed for boats and are environmentally friendly. Our cleaning agents are biodegradable and safe for use in and around water. For waxing and protection, we use high-grade marine waxes and ceramic coatings that provide lasting protection against UV damage, oxidation, and water spots."
  },
  {
    "question": "How often should I have my boat detailed?",
    "answer": "For optimal maintenance, we recommend an exterior wash after every 5-10 uses during boating season. A full detail including waxing should be done 1-2 times per year depending on usage and exposure conditions. Boats stored outside may require more frequent detailing than those kept in covered storage."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you remove oxidation from my boat?",
    "answer": "Yes, oxidation removal is one of our specialties. Depending on the severity, we use a multi-step compounding and polishing process to remove oxidation and restore your gelcoat's shine. We then apply protection to prevent future oxidation. The process is labor-intensive but can dramatically transform the appearance of your boat."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you offer any guarantees or warranties?",
    "answer": "Yes, we stand behind our work. Our services come with a satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with the results, we'll return to address any areas of concern at no additional cost. For specialized services like ceramic coatings, we offer specific warranties detailed in our service agreements."
